# SociallyResponsibleInvesting

Socially responsible investing (SRI) is a strategy that targets companies that promote ethical practices, environmental stewardship, and social justice. It draws inspiration from various periods in U.S. history, including the establishment of Quakerism (1700s) and the Civil Rights Movement (1960s). In recent years, the availability of socially responsible mutual funds and exchange-traded funds (ETFs) have facilitated easy and diversified investments consistent with various socially responsible values (e.g., clean energy, gender diversity).
